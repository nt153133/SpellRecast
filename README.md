# SpellRecast
Wrapper for RecastSharp which wraps Recast/Detour

Run make.bat in the main folder

That will generate the vs2019 project files in `RecastSharp\RecastCWrapper\Build\vs2019`
Open recastwrapper.sln and compile that for release 64 bit.

Then you can open SpellRecast sln, well for windows.
